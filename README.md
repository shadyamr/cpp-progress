# cpp-progress
I have not coded in C++ for a while and I came back to it recently because of my college. So I decided to make a simple console app where I can practice and share what do we learn in the college basically. Due to having a previous experience in C++, the code is well organized and clean without any errors. Anyone is free to use this code to learn more about C++.

#### Features in the console application:
* BMI Calculator (calculates your BMI using weight and height)
* Printing out "CPP" on the log (assigns each letter independently into 3 different variables)
* Area of Circle Calculator (calculates your AOC radius)
* Simple Sum Calculator (calculates the sum of two numbers)
* Greater Number (takes two numbers from the user and prints the greatest number)
* Odd or Even Number (takes a number from the user and checks if it is odd or even)
* MultipleBy5 Check (takes a number from the user and checks if this number is multiple by 5 or not)
